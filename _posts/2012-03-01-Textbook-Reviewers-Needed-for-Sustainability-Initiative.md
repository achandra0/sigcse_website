**Textbook Reviewers Needed for Sustainability Initiative**\
We are posting this announcement as part of SIGCSE\'s participation in
the PKAL Sustainability Initiative. Textbook publishers have seen the
demand from educators and students for sustainability-related materials
in all disciplines. Major textbook publishers Cengage and McGraw-Hill
are currently looking for reviewers and subject matter experts who can
suggest ideas about how to educate for a sustainable future. See [Call
For
Participation](../files/documents/pdfs/Textbookreviewerannoucement.pdf.html).
Thanks.
