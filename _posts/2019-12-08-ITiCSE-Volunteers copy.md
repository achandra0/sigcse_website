The Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE) celebrates its 25th anniversary in 2020. The ITiCSE steering and conference committees would like to mark the occasion with special events at the conference in Trondheim, Norway.

We are seeking volunteers to serve on an ITiCSE 25th anniversary committee. Ideal volunteers should have been involved with the ITiCSE conference in some significant way during the past 25 years and plan to attend the 2020 conference in Trondheim.

If you are interested in serving on the ITiCSE 25th anniversary committee, please send a brief statement of your previous involvement with ITiCSE and any ideas you have for the 2020 conference to Amber Settle (<asettle@cdm.depaul.edu>) by Monday, December 16th. Please also indicate if you are interested in chairing the committee.  

Some basic planning will take place in December, but the bulk of the work for the committee will begin in January 2020.
