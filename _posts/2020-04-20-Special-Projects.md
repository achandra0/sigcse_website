The SIGCSE Board regrets to announce that, due to the financial impact of the cancellation of the 2020 Technical Symposium on the SIGCSE organization, there will only be one round of SIGCSE Special Projects Grant submissions this year. The next deadline for submissions will be **November 15, 2020**.

Please note the specific requirements for the SIGCSE Special Projects Grant Application Process, including that the applicant must be a SIGCSE member to be eligible. Questions are welcome and should be sent to <apply@sigcse.org>.
