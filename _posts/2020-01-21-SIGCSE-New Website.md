We have updated our online presence with a new organization and layout of our website. The change should improve navigation/exploration of the site, improve user experience with smaller devices (smartphones, tablets), as well as make the pages faster to load. 

No content has been removed from the site, but some URLs might have changed. So if there is content that you had bookmarked and cannot find the equivalent new location, do send us an email with the missing content and we will do our best to find it.

Sincerely

The Webmaster
