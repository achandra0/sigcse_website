The SIGCSE board and ITiCSE Steering Committee are accepting applications for a new member of the ITiCSE Steering Committee. The ITiCSE Steering Committee manages the direction of the ITiCSE conference including recruiting and supporting conference committee members. The ITiCSE Steering Committee has membership from SIGCSE, Informatics Europe, and ACM-Europe. The open position is one of the two SIGCSE members on the committee.

The approved applicant will serve a three-year term beginning July 2020. Minimum qualifications in any applicant are SIGCSE membership, previous involvement at ITiCSE, and demonstrated leadership skills. The new member will be expected to attend the ITiCSE conference during their term, so only those with ongoing and significant engagement with the conference should apply. Applicants from Europe are preferred, but applicants from any geographical region will be considered. All applicants should be prepared to take an active and ongoing leadership role in the conference, including attendance at monthly, electronic meetings.

Anyone interested in applying for the position should send a CV and a brief statement of involvement with SIGCSE and the ITiCSE conference in particular to Amber Settle (<asettle@cdm.depaul.edu>) no later than **May 15, 2020**.
