**Wanted: SIGCSE Bulletin Editor**\
With the SIGCSE Bulletin becoming an electronic newsletter separate from
ACM Inroads, the electronic Bulletin needs an editor. General Duties:

-   Determine and generate content, within the broad parameters that the
    SIGCSE Bulletin is an electronic newsletter for SIGCSE members
    (scholarly work should be directed to one of the SIGCSE conferences,
    ACM Inroads, or ACM Transactions on Computing Education). ?Determine
    and generate content? may include soliciting contributions from
    others as well as writing pieces directly.
-   Ensure that the Bulletin is distributed electronically to SIGCSE
    members and posted on the SIGCSE official Web site at the beginning
    of every quarter.
-   Determine the format and appearance of the Bulletin.
-   Report regularly to the SIGCSE Board on the status of the Bulletin,
    including any need for funds; oversee expenditures of any funds
    authorized.
-   Respond to or forward, as appropriate, any Bulletin correspondence.
-   Ensure that publication of the Bulletin complies with any applicable
    ACM policies and SIGCSE Board directions.
-   Recruit or dismiss other volunteers to assist in producing the
    Bulletin as needed.

Term of Appointment - The SIGCSE Bulletin editor is appointed by the
SIGCSE Board, and serves a three-year renewable term. In order to allow
start-up time, and to synchronize the editors\' terms with the Board
election cycle, the first editor will have an initial term of
approximately four years, extending from date of appointment until June
30, 2014.

To volunteer yourself or suggest someone else, please contact Barbara
Boucher Owens, SIGCSE Chair, at <chair@sigcse.org>.
