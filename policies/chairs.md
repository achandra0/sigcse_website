**\*\*\* Please note this policy is currently under review for ICER and
CompEd \*\*\***

The following describes the process for choosing the conference
co-chairs for each of SIGCSE's three conferences.

Prospective conference chairs should normally have previous involvement
with the conference including regular attendance and participation on
past conference organizing committees. The SIGCSE Board must approve all
conference chair positions. Conference chairs must be members of SIGCSE.

<h5>SIGCSE Technical Symposium</h5>
Being either program or symposium co-chair of the SIGCSE Technical
Symposium is a two-year commitment. A nomination committee of the
symposium and program chairs for the current year and the SIGCSE Board
technical symposium liaison nominates the candidates for the co-chair
positions to the SIGCSE Board, and the board makes the final
appointments.

Criteria for Candidates for Symposium Co-Chair:

-   Must be a SIGCSE member
-   Demonstrated interest in the SIGCSE community
-   Regular attendance at the SIGCSE Technical Symposium
-   Prior service on Symposium organizing or Program committees, with
    preference to those who have served in different positions (service
    to other conferences would also be considered)
-   Collaborative and organizational skills sufficient to work with
    Symposium Committee and conference logistics company to oversee a
    large conference
-   Collaborate with Symposium Treasurer to manage a \$700,000+ budget
-   Preference given to those whose department or employer will give
    credit or release time for the position.

Criteria for Candidates for Program Co-Chair:

-   Must be a SIGCSE member
-   Prior SIGCSE publications
-   Prior service as SIGCSE reviewer (additional service as APC
    preferable)
-   Demonstrated record of scholarly activity in computing education
-   Demonstrated interest in the SIGCSE community
-   Preference given to those with prior program organization or editor
    experience
-   Collaborative and organizational skills sufficient to work with the
    other Program Chairs and the Program Committee and to share
    oversight of the program selection process

<h5>ITiCSE Conference</h5>

Chairing the ITiCSE Conference is a two-year commitment. The senior
chair hosts the conference and serves as the junior chair in the
previous year. The ITiCSE conference is normally held at the conference
chair's university. However, with Board approval, the conference may be
held at another location not directly associated with the host's
university. The ITiCSE conference is held in or near Europe in June or
July.

The ITiCSE Steering Committee (SC) conducts open calls for parties
interested in hosting an ITiCSE conference. After vetting applicants,
the SC proposes conference chairs and venues to the SIGCSE Board which
approves the potential chair and a site visit conducted by SC members.
More information is available from SC chair Michael KÃ¶lling:
<michael.kolling@KCL.AC.UK>.

Prospective ITiCSE conference chairs should normally have previous
involvement with the conference including regular attendance and
participation on past conference organizing committees. Past working
group participation or leadership is an asset.

<h5>ICER Workshop</h5>

The ICER Workshop alternates in a four-year cycle, moving from North
America to Europe to North America to Australasia.

Each year, the SIGCSE Board appoints a new Site chair and a new Program
chair. Both appointments are for two years, with the first year
designated the "junior" year and the second year designated the "senior"
year. Site Chairs host the conference at their home institution during
their senior year. In any given year, the senior Site and senior Program
chairs will be the Conference co-chairs and the junior Site and junior
Program chairs will be the Associate chairs.

Each year the junior Site and Program co-chairs will issue a call for
new chairs in early October to close at the end of November. A
nomination committee of the Site and Program co-chairs and the SIGCSE
Board ICER liaison nominates the ICER Site chair and Program chair to
start serving two years from the current year. For example, the
Conference and Associate co-chairs for 2018 and the Board ICER liaison
will nominate the Site chair and Program co-chair to serve their first
year in 2020. Once the nomination committee proposes a Site chair, the
prospective Site chair must submit a proposal to the SIGCSE Board for
approval of both the Site chair and the conference venue. The
nominations will be reviewed at the following February/March Board
meeting.

Prospective ICER chairs should have previous involvement with the
conference and demonstrated interest in the computing education research
community. Prospective Program chairs should have prior publications at
ICER, past service on the Senior Program Committee, and research
excellence in computing education.
